Driven to transform complex data into clear, actionable business strategies. I combine a strong foundation in financial analysis (banking) and operational efficiency (property management) with a passion for modern Business Intelligence tools.Core Focus:
BI & Analytics: SQL, Power BI, Excel (Pivot Tables, Macros), Data Modeling, Financial Analysis.
Impact: I specialize in designing and maintaining dashboards, automating reporting workflows (e.g., cutting report generation time by 40% using SQL), and leading teams to data-driven, top-tier performance.
🛠️ Open for Collaboration

I'm always open to discussing new projects, collaboration opportunities, or technical challenges. Feel free to reach out if you have a project you'd like to outsource or partner on—especially those involving data visualization, performance analytics, or strategic growth.🎧 Beyond the Data

When I'm not optimizing a data model, you can find me:
🎧 Audio Engineering: Deep-diving into sound design and mixing. It’s another way I combine technical skill with creative problem-solving.
🧑‍🍳 Cooking Food: Exploring new cuisines and perfecting classic recipes. The precision and experimentation required in cooking are surprisingly similar to good data work!</p>
